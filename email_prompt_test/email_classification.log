User message : Our receiver let us know that this order arrived damaged (please see attached photos). Can you please advise on replacements? Thanks! - Sub_Intent Identified : REPLACEMENT_REQUEST
User message : This message is in reference to order #285550 that was placed in November of 2022. It took almost 1 whole year to finally receive this order. The chairs were delivered to us in September of 2023 after continued delays in production and shipment. We have spent the last month on site at our client's residence installing our largest project to date. A project that will complete Brittany's published book with Rizzoli, and will make up the majority of the book. These chairs have been in our client's possession for less than 1 month, and already we have had one break. This is completely unacceptable given the time that it took for these chairs to arrive, and the little time that our clients have actually had them. Please see the attached photos of the broken leg on one of the chairs. We have sent this to our woodshop repair technician who was able to salvage the chair leg, and we now owe a balance of $225 for the repair. A photo of the invoice from the repair is also attached. We would greatly appreciate a partial refund to cover the cost of this repair. We are less than satisfied with our overall experience with this order and have strongly reconsidered future purchases. All my best, Maddy Brittany Bromley Interiors 5902 S.

User message : Hello, My furniture order arrived and the top was broken. Below are pictures and the delivery company also took pictures and made note of this. No one has contacted me from Wisteria to make this right which is disappointing. Please respond with either a full refund of the item or expedited replacement of the broken part. - Sub_Intent Identified : DAMAGED_DURING_SHIPPING
User message : Thank you for your email. I want to clarify that I did not return anything. I live on the third floor, and the delivery company couldnâ€™t fit the display case in the elevator or up the stairs, so they couldn't deliver it. The desk, which arrived broken, was pointless to accept without the matching pieces. I did not refuse delivery, and I shouldn't have to pay for the broken desk, display, or chair, as I purchased them all together. I still want the furniture and would like to arrange a delayed delivery for late summer to my new first-floor home. Thank you for your help! - Sub_Intent Identified : OTHERS

Email History: User: Subject: question, Body:My order 295932 is spoiled i dont like its packing and i want to return it Bot: Hi Sai Prakash Reddy, I'm sorry to hear that there are issues with your order. While we strive to ensure every delivery is in perfect condition, sometimes damages can occur during shipment. To assist you further, could you please provide us with the following photos? This will help us understand the situation better: A photo of the damaged item. A photo showing the damaged merchandise, inside the original box, with all of the original cushioning (the picture should show the placement of the merchandise and packaging inside the box). A close-up photo of the shipping label with the tracking number (please zoom in enough to read the tracking number). Photos that show the box itself, especially if there was any damage to the box. Once we receive these images, we will be able to offer you options, including sending a replacement or discussing other resolutions. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if there is anything else I can assist you with.

This will help us address the situation effectively:\nA photo of the damaged item.\nA photo showing the damaged merchandise, inside the original box, with all of the original cushioning (the picture should show the placement of the merchandise and packaging inside the box).\nA close-up photo of the shipping label with the tracking number (please zoom in enough to read the tracking number).\nPhotos that show the box itself, especially if there was any damage to the box.\nOnce we receive these photos, we will be able to offer you options, including sending a replacement or processing a refund.\nIn the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if there is anything else I can assist you with.
User Latest Email: Hi Travis,\nI want to follow up on this, as itâ€™s been a week since I last heard from you. I really need resolution on this matter, so I can move forward figuring out how to get it installed. The installation isnâ€™t simple\ngiven the location of the studs and place of the mirror hooks. As I said previously, we paid for this installation as part of our remodel contract, but because of the extensive mirror delay, we could not keep\nour contracts on for multiple more months and had to finish the rest of our project without the mirror being installed. Now I must take the time and money to find someone trusted and pay them to install it. If\nresolution isnâ€™t reached, I will need to investigate other options with regard to having paid for a product with published timeframe that was months delayed. \nI am concerned that wisteria is trying to avoid responsibility for their mistake and delay, given how much back and forth this is taking and greater delay. I am now having to put a meaningful amount of my time\ntrying to get wisteria to make their mistake right. This is unacceptable yet again. If this is on resolved expediently, I will have no choice but to escalate my approach. And then that just increases my time\nrequired and thus what is appropriate for resolution.

}Intent Examples: User message : Apparently the mirror was damaged by UPS. So Wisteria Customer Service reachced out to UPS and I think they arranged the return to the supplier NOT TO ME. I was offered to get a replacement and at that time I said ok, I wasn't in a rush so apparently I was supposed to wait 3 weeks. I agreed because I wanted my mirror BUT IT NEVER ARRIVED And I've sent a couple of emails to Wisteria Customer Service asking about the status of my order. AND no answer has been received. SO, Today I have the time to claim and ask for my refund.

User message : I order a mirror. it wasn't delivered. I kept tracking the package and UPS didn't have the info. So I reached out to Wisteria Customer Service around April 5th or so. TRavis checked everything - Intent Identified : ORDER_STATUS
User message : The website stated that it was in stock and ready to ship at the time of my purchase. It was part of the deciding factor in my purchase. If your website was mislabeling the stock, then that is in fact falsely advertised to your consumer. The fact that you are holding my funds but have not sent me tracking information, and are later telling me that the item was not actually in stock at the time of purchase is not creating a pleasant customer experience. I own my own small company (significantly smaller than Wisteria) and am also in the customer service industry. I don't think any consumer should have to feel this level of uncertainty when making a big purchase. I've been eyeing this piece for about 4 years now since first seeing it on a designer's instagram page, and am now deeply disappointed. \n\nI do not need a wood sample, as I don't know how long that would take. I would like photos of the wood. If it is yellow/orange we can just cancel all together. - Intent Identified : OTHERS
User message : I was not happy with the condition of the furniture when I refused delivery of the piece earlier this week. I left detailed notes with the delivery team which was recorded into their delivery mobile app. I explained how the color did not match the color of the piece of furniture on the Wisteria website and how the execution of the paint work was poor and to a low quality. I would like a full refund for that piece, and due to the furniture not meeting expectations, I would request not to be charged a delivery and restock fee. Many thanks - Intent Identified : OTHERS

User message : I still have not received any updates about my broken furniture - Sub_Intent Identified : OTHERS
User message : This message is in reference to order #285550 that was placed in November of 2022. It took almost 1 whole year to finally receive this order. The chairs were delivered to us in September of 2023 after continued delays in production and shipment. We have spent the last month on site at our client's residence installing our largest project to date. A project that will complete Brittany's published book with Rizzoli, and will make up the majority of the book. These chairs have been in our client's possession for less than 1 month, and already we have had one break. This is completely unacceptable given the time that it took for these chairs to arrive, and the little time that our clients have actually had them. Please see the attached photos of the broken leg on one of the chairs. We have sent this to our woodshop repair technician who was able to salvage the chair leg, and we now owe a balance of $225 for the repair. A photo of the invoice from the repair is also attached. We would greatly appreciate a partial refund to cover the cost of this repair. We are less than satisfied with our overall experience with this order and have strongly reconsidered future purchases.

Sub Intent Examples: User message : Hello, My furniture order arrived and the top was broken. Below are pictures and the delivery company also took pictures and made note of this. No one has contacted me from Wisteria to make this right which is disappointing. Please respond with either a full refund of the item or expedited replacement of the broken part. - Sub_Intent Identified : DAMAGED_DURING_SHIPPING
User message : Thank you for your email. I want to clarify that I did not return anything. I live on the third floor, and the delivery company couldnâ€™t fit the display case in the elevator or up the stairs, so they couldn't deliver it. The desk, which arrived broken, was pointless to accept without the matching pieces. I did not refuse delivery, and I shouldn't have to pay for the broken desk, display, or chair, as I purchased them all together. I still want the furniture and would like to arrange a delayed delivery for late summer to my new first-floor home. Thank you for your help! - Sub_Intent Identified : OTHERS
User message : Per your request, attached please find photos of the broken marble and damage to the desk (these were taken by the delivery team). Also, the delivery team could not get the display case into the elevator or up the stairs, so we could not take delivery of that either. Given none of the items could be delivered, I refused the chair as it didnâ€™t make sense to just accept that alone. Please let me know if you have any further questions at all. Thank you! - Sub_Intent Identified : OTHERS
User message : Our receiver let us know that this order arrived damaged (please see attached photos). Can you please advise on replacements? Thanks! - Sub_Intent Identified : REPLACEMENT_REQUEST
User message : I have not received a response on replacing the 2 chairs. One damaged in shipping and the other that does not match. Can you please process the replacements? Thank you - Sub_Intent Identified : REPLACEMENT_REQUEST
