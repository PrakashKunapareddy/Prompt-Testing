User Latest Email:  A leg of the chair is missing can you please look into my problem
Intent Examples: User message : The chair I ordered arrived with broken legs and scuffs, and I want to return it immediately. Can you help me with the return process? - Intent Identified : Damages
User message : My office chair has started to break down after just a month of use. How do I report this damage and request assistance? - Intent Identified : Damages
User message : This message is in reference to order #285550 that was placed in November of 2022. It took almost 1 whole year to finally receive this order. The chairs were delivered to us in September of 2023 after continued delays in production and shipment. We have spent the last month on site at our client's residence installing our largest project to date. A project that will complete Brittany's published book with Rizzoli, and will make up the majority of the book. These chairs have been in our client's possession for less than 1 month, and already we have had one break. This is completely unacceptable given the time that it took for these chairs to arrive, and the little time that our clients have actually had them. Please see the attached photos of the broken leg on one of the chairs. We have sent this to our woodshop repair technician who was able to salvage the chair leg, and we now owe a balance of $225 for the repair. A photo of the invoice from the repair is also attached. We would greatly appreciate a partial refund to cover the cost of this repair. We are less than satisfied with our overall experience with this order and have strongly reconsidered future purchases.

User message : Thank you for your email. I want to clarify that I did not return anything. I live on the third floor, and the delivery company couldn’t fit the display case in the elevator or up the stairs, so they couldn't deliver it. The desk, which arrived broken, was pointless to accept without the matching pieces. I did not refuse delivery, and I shouldn't have to pay for the broken desk, display, or chair, as I purchased them all together. I still want the furniture and would like to arrange a delayed delivery for late summer to my new first-floor home. Thank you for your help! - Sub_Intent Identified : OTHERS

Email History: User:Subject:Return #294652,Body:Hello, I was in touch with you and your HQ on this order last week. One of the two tables was shipped and I received it. Please do not ship the second and I need to return the one I have (2 boxes for the one table) and be refunded for both. The marble top just sits on top of the base and does not secure to it, making it too precarious. If someone leaned on the table at all the top will topple over. Please confirm the second table won’t ship and the process for returning the one I have. 
Bot: Hi Marisa, Thank you for reaching out regarding your order. I’m pleased to inform you that both Iron & Marble Side Tables are eligible for return within the return period. Please box up your items in the original packaging, print and attach the UPS return label included in this email, and bring your package to a nearby UPS store. They will handle the rest! Please note, if the products are not sent back in their original packaging and damage occurs, you may incur additional costs. For your convenience, I have included the UPS return label. Upon receipt and inspection of the products, we will issue a refund to your original payment method. Once the refund is processed, please allow 3-5 business days for any credits to be applied back to your account. Note that a restocking fee of 10% will be deducted from the refunded amount, as well as the shipping cost. Please visit the Returns Policy section of our website for more information. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Best regards, Cassy
