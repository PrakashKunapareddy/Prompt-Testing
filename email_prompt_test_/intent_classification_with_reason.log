Please do not ship the second and I need to return the one I have (2 boxes for the one table) and be refunded for both. The marble top just sits on top of the base and does not secure to it, making it too precarious. If someone leaned on the table at all the top will topple over. Please confirm the second table won’t ship and the process for returning the one I have.

Email History:: User: Subject:Order #295290, Body:Please issue a return label for this item. Unfortunately this is very different from the one shown on your website. It's also lightweight and much cheaper construction than the original 3 I ordered from you.This stool does not work, nor match as photos implied. For these reasons I should not be required to pay the return shipping fee./nThank you!
