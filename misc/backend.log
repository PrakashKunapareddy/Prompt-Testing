The marble top just sits on top of the base and does not secure to it, making it too precarious. If someone leaned on the table at all the top will topple over. Please confirm the second table won’t ship and the process for returning the one I have. AI: Hi Marisa,\n\nThank you for reaching out regarding your order.\n\nI’m pleased to inform you that both Iron & Marble Side Tables are eligible for return within the return period. Please box up your items in the original packaging, print and attach the UPS return label included\nin this email, and bring your package to a nearby UPS store. They will handle the rest! Please note, if the products are not sent back in their original packaging and damage occurs, you may incur additional\ncosts.\n\nFor your convenience, I have included the UPS return label.\n\nUpon receipt and inspection of the products, we will issue a refund to your original payment method. Once the refund is processed, please allow 3-5 business days for any credits to be applied back to your\naccount. Note that a restocking fee of 10% will be deducted from the refunded amount, as well as the shipping cost.

While we strive to ensure every delivery is in perfect condition, sometimes damages can occur during shipment.\nTo assist you further, could you please provide us with the following photos? This will help us understand the situation better:\nA photo of the damaged item.\nA photo showing the damaged merchandise, inside the original box, with all of the original cushioning (the picture should show the placement of the merchandise and packaging inside the box).\nA close-up photo of the shipping label with the tracking number (please zoom in enough to read the tracking number).\nPhotos that show the box itself, especially if there was any damage to the box.\nOnce we receive these images, we will be able to offer you options, including sending a replacement or discussing other resolutions.\nIn the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if there is anything else I can assist you with.

user_latest_email_body: Hi- I’m not sure directly who to contact but I purchased the glass waterfall table through Wisteria in either 2018 or 2019. Today this table which is located in our den quite literally exploded. My 4 year old was miraculously not in the room nor my dog, but I am certain this explosion could’ve killed someone. From the research I’ve done it can be some type of gas trapped in the glass during the manufacturing process. I think it’s imperative that this issue be circulated upwards as these tables need to be recalled and/or replaced to consumers who have these inside their homes with children, pets, loved ones- My 4yo son sliced his leg open. This is extremely concerning and i look forward to hearing from your company. \nThank You

AI: Hi Laurie,Thank you for reaching out regarding your order.\nOrder ID: #295645\nOrder Date: 8/1/2024\nItem Number: 110-111130-NATWOOD\nItem Name: Barley Twist Desk\nThe estimated shipping date for your item is October 22, 2024. We will provide a tracking URL as soon as it is available.\nIs there anything else I can assist you with?\nBest Regards,
user_latest_email_body: The end of October?! This is extremely disappointing. When I bought the desk it was listed as having an “end of August” shipping estimate. Then after taking my money you told me an “early October” shipping. Now this? This feels like a bait and switch. Honest expectations would be a better way to run a business.

email_history: Human: Unacceptable delay - Order #293374, - Hi Travis,\nWhile waiting on resolution of this issue, I do want to let you know that we received and opened the mirror, and it is indeed beautiful. This doesn’t remove the time and monetary hit of getting it installed\nafter our contractors are gone, but do want to recognize the quality of the item. \nThanks,\nApril AI:Hi April,\nI'm sorry to hear that your order arrived with missing attachments. While we strive to ensure every order is complete, sometimes issues can arise during shipment.\nTo assist you further, could you please provide us with as many of the following photos as you can? This will help us address the situation effectively:\nA photo of the damaged item.\nA photo showing the damaged merchandise, inside the original box, with all of the original cushioning (the picture should show the placement of the merchandise and packaging inside the box).\nA close-up photo of the shipping label with the tracking number (please zoom in enough to read the tracking number).\nPhotos that show the box itself, especially if there was any damage to the box.\nOnce we receive these photos, we will be able to offer you options, including sending a replacement or processing a refund.\nIn the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if there is anything else I can assist you with.
user_latest_email_body: Hi Travis,\nI want to follow up on this, as it’s been a week since I last heard from you. I really need resolution on this matter, so I can move forward figuring out how to get it installed. The installation isn’t simple\ngiven the location of the studs and place of the mirror hooks. As I said previously, we paid for this installation as part of our remodel contract, but because of the extensive mirror delay, we could not keep\nour contracts on for multiple more months and had to finish the rest of our project without the mirror being installed. Now I must take the time and money to find someone trusted and pay them to install it. If\nresolution isn’t reached, I will need to investigate other options with regard to having paid for a product with published timeframe that was months delayed. \nI am concerned that wisteria is trying to avoid responsibility for their mistake and delay, given how much back and forth this is taking and greater delay. I am now having to put a meaningful amount of my time\ntrying to get wisteria to make their mistake right. This is unacceptable yet again. If this is on resolved expediently, I will have no choice but to escalate my approach. And then that just increases my time\nrequired and thus what is appropriate for resolution.

user_latest_email_body: I am writing because I have been trying to process a return and full refund for a defective pendant light that I ordered in September. The product issue number is #296005. I first called to complain about it being defective in early October, and I have been communicating with Ashley from the Wisteria Custome Care Team, since then but she stopped responding, and the last email I have from her is from October 16. I would like to return the light and receive a full refund, given that it is defective. I no longer want to try a replacement, as it was taking several weeks even to get that processed and I am no longer confident that the replacement pendant will be of acceptable quality or that I will get the customer support I need if it, too, is defective.
