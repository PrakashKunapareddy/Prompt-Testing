User message : The website stated that it was in stock and ready to ship at the time of my purchase. It was part of the deciding factor in my purchase. If your website was mislabeling the stock, then that is in fact falsely advertised to your consumer. The fact that you are holding my funds but have not sent me tracking information, and are later telling me that the item was not actually in stock at the time of purchase is not creating a pleasant customer experience. I own my own small company (significantly smaller than Wisteria) and am also in the customer service industry. I don't think any consumer should have to feel this level of uncertainty when making a big purchase. I've been eyeing this piece for about 4 years now since first seeing it on a designer's instagram page, and am now deeply disappointed. \n\nI do not need a wood sample, as I don't know how long that would take. I would like photos of the wood. If it is yellow/orange we can just cancel all together. - Intent Identified : Others
User message : Hello, My furniture order arrived and the top was broken. Below are pictures and the delivery company also took pictures and made note of this.

User message : When will my bar chairs arrive? - Intent Identified : Order Status
User message : This message is in reference to order #285550 that was placed in November of 2022. It took almost 1 whole year to finally receive this order. The chairs were delivered to us in September of 2023 after continued delays in production and shipment. We have spent the last month on site at our client's residence installing our largest project to date. A project that will complete Brittany's published book with Rizzoli, and will make up the majority of the book. These chairs have been in our client's possession for less than 1 month, and already we have had one break. This is completely unacceptable given the time that it took for these chairs to arrive, and the little time that our clients have actually had them. Please see the attached photos of the broken leg on one of the chairs. We have sent this to our woodshop repair technician who was able to salvage the chair leg, and we now owe a balance of $225 for the repair. A photo of the invoice from the repair is also attached. We would greatly appreciate a partial refund to cover the cost of this repair. We are less than satisfied with our overall experience with this order and have strongly reconsidered future purchases. All my best, Maddy Brittany Bromley Interiors 5902 S.

User message : I was not happy with the condition of the furniture when I refused delivery of the piece earlier this week. I left detailed notes with the delivery team which was recorded into their delivery mobile app. I explained how the color did not match the color of the piece of furniture on the Wisteria website and how the execution of the paint work was poor and to a low quality. I would like a full refund for that piece, and due to the furniture not meeting expectations, I would request not to be charged a delivery and restock fee. Many thanks - Intent Identified : Others

To assist you further, could you please provide us with the following photos? This will help us understand the situation better: A photo of the damaged item. A photo showing the damaged merchandise, inside the original box, with all of the original cushioning (the picture should show the placement of the merchandise and packaging inside the box). A close-up photo of the shipping label with the tracking number (please zoom in enough to read the tracking number). Photos that show the box itself, especially if there was any damage to the box. Once we receive these images, we will be able to offer you options, including sending a replacement or discussing other resolutions. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if there is anything else I can assist you with.

I live on the third floor, and the delivery company couldn’t fit the display case in the elevator or up the stairs, so they couldn't deliver it. The desk, which arrived broken, was pointless to accept without the matching pieces. I did not refuse delivery, and I shouldn't have to pay for the broken desk, display, or chair, as I purchased them all together. I still want the furniture and would like to arrange a delayed delivery for late summer to my new first-floor home. Thank you for your help! - Intent Identified : Damages

User Latest Email :: Dear Wisteria Team, I am writing to express my extreme frustration regarding the delay in the delivery of my recent order. I had planned a vacation, I was assured that the order would arrive on time, and I made arrangements accordingly. However, the delay has not only ruined my vacation plans but has also caused me a great deal of inconvenience and stress. As the only one who needed to receive this order, the impact of this situation is significant. I am now left with no choice but to cancel my vacation due to this issue. I would like to initiate a return for my order. Please provide me with the necessary steps to process this return as soon as possible. I expect a prompt resolution to this matter. Thank you for your attention to this urgent issue. Sincerely, Merrick Garland

I would like a full refund for that piece, and due to the furniture not meeting expectations, I would request not to be charged a delivery and restock fee. Many thanks - Intent Identified : Others

User message : The website stated that it was in stock and ready to ship at the time of my purchase. It was part of the deciding factor in my purchase. If your website was mislabeling the stock, then that is in fact falsely advertised to your consumer. The fact that you are holding my funds but have not sent me tracking information, and are later telling me that the item was not actually in stock at the time of purchase is not creating a pleasant customer experience. I own my own small company (significantly smaller than Wisteria) and am also in the customer service industry. I don't think any consumer should have to feel this level of uncertainty when making a big purchase. I've been eyeing this piece for about 4 years now since first seeing it on a designer's instagram page, and am now deeply disappointed. \n\nI do not need a wood sample, as I don't know how long that would take. I would like photos of the wood. If it is yellow/orange we can just cancel all together. - Intent Identified : Others

Please box up your items in the original packaging, print and attach the UPS return label included in this email, and bring your package to a nearby UPS store. They will handle the rest! Please note, if the products are not sent back in their original packaging and damage occurs, you may incur additional costs. For your convenience, I have included the UPS return label. Upon receipt and inspection of the products, we will issue a refund to your original payment method. Once the refund is processed, please allow 3-5 business days for any credits to be applied back to your account. Note that a restocking fee of 10% will be deducted from the refunded amount, as well as the shipping cost. Please visit the Returns Policy section of our website for more information. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Best regards, Cassy

User message : The website stated that it was in stock and ready to ship at the time of my purchase. It was part of the deciding factor in my purchase. If your website was mislabeling the stock, then that is in fact falsely advertised to your consumer. The fact that you are holding my funds but have not sent me tracking information, and are later telling me that the item was not actually in stock at the time of purchase is not creating a pleasant customer experience. I own my own small company (significantly smaller than Wisteria) and am also in the customer service industry. I don't think any consumer should have to feel this level of uncertainty when making a big purchase. I've been eyeing this piece for about 4 years now since first seeing it on a designer's instagram page, and am now deeply disappointed. \n\nI do not need a wood sample, as I don't know how long that would take. I would like photos of the wood. If it is yellow/orange we can just cancel all together. - Intent Identified : Others
User message : Hello, My furniture order arrived and the top was broken. Below are pictures and the delivery company also took pictures and made note of this.

User message : When will my bar chairs arrive? - Intent Identified : Order Status
User message : This message is in reference to order #285550 that was placed in November of 2022. It took almost 1 whole year to finally receive this order. The chairs were delivered to us in September of 2023 after continued delays in production and shipment. We have spent the last month on site at our client's residence installing our largest project to date. A project that will complete Brittany's published book with Rizzoli, and will make up the majority of the book. These chairs have been in our client's possession for less than 1 month, and already we have had one break. This is completely unacceptable given the time that it took for these chairs to arrive, and the little time that our clients have actually had them. Please see the attached photos of the broken leg on one of the chairs. We have sent this to our woodshop repair technician who was able to salvage the chair leg, and we now owe a balance of $225 for the repair. A photo of the invoice from the repair is also attached. We would greatly appreciate a partial refund to cover the cost of this repair. We are less than satisfied with our overall experience with this order and have strongly reconsidered future purchases. All my best, Maddy Brittany Bromley Interiors 5902 S.

User message : I was not happy with the condition of the furniture when I refused delivery of the piece earlier this week. I left detailed notes with the delivery team which was recorded into their delivery mobile app. I explained how the color did not match the color of the piece of furniture on the Wisteria website and how the execution of the paint work was poor and to a low quality. I would like a full refund for that piece, and due to the furniture not meeting expectations, I would request not to be charged a delivery and restock fee. Many thanks - Intent Identified : Others

To assist you further, could you please provide us with the following photos? This will help us understand the situation better: A photo of the damaged item. A photo showing the damaged merchandise, inside the original box, with all of the original cushioning (the picture should show the placement of the merchandise and packaging inside the box). A close-up photo of the shipping label with the tracking number (please zoom in enough to read the tracking number). Photos that show the box itself, especially if there was any damage to the box. Once we receive these images, we will be able to offer you options, including sending a replacement or discussing other resolutions. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if there is anything else I can assist you with.

I had sent a photo to customer service when placing the order to confirm the shade. While I understand reclaimed wood will be slightly different, the tone of the wood should not be veer too far off the original color. The customer service associate assured me that it is the color I had sent in the photo from interior designer Harlowe James.

User message : The website stated that it was in stock and ready to ship at the time of my purchase. It was part of the deciding factor in my purchase. If your website was mislabeling the stock, then that is in fact falsely advertised to your consumer. The fact that you are holding my funds but have not sent me tracking information, and are later telling me that the item was not actually in stock at the time of purchase is not creating a pleasant customer experience. I own my own small company (significantly smaller than Wisteria) and am also in the customer service industry. I don't think any consumer should have to feel this level of uncertainty when making a big purchase. I've been eyeing this piece for about 4 years now since first seeing it on a designer's instagram page, and am now deeply disappointed. \n\nI do not need a wood sample, as I don't know how long that would take.

I had sent a photo to customer service when placing the order to confirm the shade.

The customer service associate assured me that it is the color I had sent in the photo from interior designer Harlowe James.

I had sent a photo to customer service when placing the order to confirm the shade. While I understand reclaimed wood will be slightly different, the tone of the wood should not be veer too far off the original color. The customer service associate assured me that it is the color I had sent in the photo from interior designer Harlowe James.

Also, the delivery team could not get the display case into the elevator or up the stairs, so we could not take delivery of that either.

User message : Thank you for your email. I want to clarify that I did not return anything. I live on the third floor, and the delivery company couldn’t fit the display case in the elevator or up the stairs, so they couldn't deliver it. The desk, which arrived broken, was pointless to accept without the matching pieces. I did not refuse delivery, and I shouldn't have to pay for the broken desk, display, or chair, as I purchased them all together. I still want the furniture and would like to arrange a delayed delivery for late summer to my new first-floor home. Thank you for your help! - Intent Identified : Damages

Examples:: User message : customer wanted information on Benten Counter/Bar Stools. - Intent Identified : Product Availabiltiy
User message : The website stated that it was in stock and ready to ship at the time of my purchase. It was part of the deciding factor in my purchase. If your website was mislabeling the stock, then that is in fact falsely advertised to your consumer. The fact that you are holding my funds but have not sent me tracking information, and are later telling me that the item was not actually in stock at the time of purchase is not creating a pleasant customer experience. I own my own small company (significantly smaller than Wisteria) and am also in the customer service industry. I don't think any consumer should have to feel this level of uncertainty when making a big purchase. I've been eyeing this piece for about 4 years now since first seeing it on a designer's instagram page, and am now deeply disappointed. \n\nI do not need a wood sample, as I don't know how long that would take. I would like photos of the wood. If it is yellow/orange we can just cancel all together. - Intent Identified : Others
User message : Hello, My furniture order arrived and the top was broken. Below are pictures and the delivery company also took pictures and made note of this.

User message : When will my bar chairs arrive? - Intent Identified : Order Status
User message : This message is in reference to order #285550 that was placed in November of 2022. It took almost 1 whole year to finally receive this order. The chairs were delivered to us in September of 2023 after continued delays in production and shipment. We have spent the last month on site at our client's residence installing our largest project to date. A project that will complete Brittany's published book with Rizzoli, and will make up the majority of the book. These chairs have been in our client's possession for less than 1 month, and already we have had one break. This is completely unacceptable given the time that it took for these chairs to arrive, and the little time that our clients have actually had them. Please see the attached photos of the broken leg on one of the chairs. We have sent this to our woodshop repair technician who was able to salvage the chair leg, and we now owe a balance of $225 for the repair. A photo of the invoice from the repair is also attached. We would greatly appreciate a partial refund to cover the cost of this repair. We are less than satisfied with our overall experience with this order and have strongly reconsidered future purchases. All my best, Maddy Brittany Bromley Interiors 5902 S.

User message : I was not happy with the condition of the furniture when I refused delivery of the piece earlier this week. I left detailed notes with the delivery team which was recorded into their delivery mobile app. I explained how the color did not match the color of the piece of furniture on the Wisteria website and how the execution of the paint work was poor and to a low quality. I would like a full refund for that piece, and due to the furniture not meeting expectations, I would request not to be charged a delivery and restock fee. Many thanks - Intent Identified : Others

User message : The website stated that it was in stock and ready to ship at the time of my purchase. It was part of the deciding factor in my purchase. If your website was mislabeling the stock, then that is in fact falsely advertised to your consumer. The fact that you are holding my funds but have not sent me tracking information, and are later telling me that the item was not actually in stock at the time of purchase is not creating a pleasant customer experience. I own my own small company (significantly smaller than Wisteria) and am also in the customer service industry. I don't think any consumer should have to feel this level of uncertainty when making a big purchase. I've been eyeing this piece for about 4 years now since first seeing it on a designer's instagram page, and am now deeply disappointed. \n\nI do not need a wood sample, as I don't know how long that would take. I would like photos of the wood. If it is yellow/orange we can just cancel all together. - Intent Identified : Others

User message : Thank you for your email. I want to clarify that I did not return anything. I live on the third floor, and the delivery company couldn’t fit the display case in the elevator or up the stairs, so they couldn't deliver it. The desk, which arrived broken, was pointless to accept without the matching pieces. I did not refuse delivery, and I shouldn't have to pay for the broken desk, display, or chair, as I purchased them all together. I still want the furniture and would like to arrange a delayed delivery for late summer to my new first-floor home. Thank you for your help! - Intent Identified : Damages

I had sent a photo to customer service when placing the order to confirm the shade. While I understand reclaimed wood will be slightly different, the tone of the wood should not be veer too far off the original color. The customer service associate assured me that it is the color I had sent in the photo from interior designer Harlowe James. If what you are saying is true that you just received the container and it has not been unpacked I am not sure how the previous associate could have confirmed the shade of the wood; he would not have seen it..  - Intent Identified : Others
